# Sales Prediction for Don Colchón  
_By Darío Acosta Natividad_

## **Project Overview**  
"Don Colchón" is a company specializing in mattress sales across Mexico. Due to the large dimensions of mattresses, their transportation and storage incur significant costs. The company relied on a predictive model with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 50%, which proved insufficient for effective operational planning. This project aimed to develop a more accurate predictive model to optimize inventory and reduce operational costs.
